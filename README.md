## Project Overview: Stage 3
In order to get started you need to go here and fork the [server repository](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) and then place both this and the server repository in one master folder side by side. Follow the code for the set up of the server within the README.md file within the repository. All credit goes to the creators of the repository and contributors and I in no way take credit.


### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
